								Over the years, I have accumulated many skills that allow me to

								and create adaptive interfaces My skills include developing web
								applications using the Rest API for data exchange, working with
								the Git version control system, creating components using the
								ReactJS library, ReactTs, as well as working with various
								frameworks and libraries such as Redux, Mobx, and RTK Query . I
								am also experienced in creating responsive interfaces using

								Firebase and Axios, which allows me to develop more scalable and
								faster applications. In general, I consider myself an
